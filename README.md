A Python version of the iLQG 
-- Iterative LQG program for nonlinear plants with bounded controls based on the algorithm described in: 
Todorov, E. and Li, W. (2005) A generalized iterative LQG method for locally-optimal feedback control of constrained nonlinear stochastic systems.


CAUTION!
--------
I met some problems when I replicated the paper with Python,
Even though it seems to worke, I am not sure the code is 100% right.

So, please do check the code carefully before you use it somewhere.
I appreciate any feedback from you.


To run the code:
Python tb.py


Cheers,
Dorje
